# Virtual Try-On Fix - Issue Resolution

## Problem
Virtual try-on feature was failing with error: "Could not find image in Gemini response"
- API calls were succeeding (200 OK)
- Images were being generated by Gemini
- But image extraction was failing silently

## Root Causes

### 1. Wrong Authentication Method
**Issue:** API key passed as URL query parameter
```java
// Before
String apiUrl = "...?key=" + googleApiKey;
```

**Problem:**
- Insecure (exposes key in URLs/logs)
- Not Google's recommended approach
- May have affected response format

### 2. Response Field Naming Mismatch
**Issue:** Code searched for `inline_data` (snake_case), but API returned `inlineData` (camelCase)

```java
// Before - Only checked snake_case
if (part.has("inline_data")) { ... }
```

**Actual API Response:**
```json
{
  "candidates": [{
    "content": {
      "parts": [{
        "inlineData": {        // ← camelCase!
          "mimeType": "image/png",
          "data": "base64..."
        }
      }]
    }
  }]
}
```

## Solution

### Fix 1: Use Header Authentication
```java
// After
String apiUrl = googleApiUrl + "models/" + googleModel + ":generateContent";
request.header("x-goog-api-key", googleApiKey);
```

### Fix 2: Support Both Naming Conventions
```java
// After - Checks both formats
if (part.has("inlineData")) {
    inlineData = part.path("inlineData");
} else if (part.has("inline_data")) {
    inlineData = part.path("inline_data");
}
```

## Files Modified
- `backend/src/main/java/com/textiletryon/service/AITryOnService.java`
  - Line 183-188: Removed query param, use header auth
  - Line 251: Added `x-goog-api-key` header
  - Line 288-305: Updated response parsing logic

## Result
✅ Try-on feature now works correctly
✅ Images are properly extracted from Gemini API responses
✅ More secure authentication method

**Date Fixed:** 2025-10-16
**Issue Duration:** The API was always working; parsing logic was the blocker
